1) You MUST use FMOD Designer version 4.30.06. http://www.mediafire.com/?negbyq1dt8dwo1e
1) You may use mp3, wav or ogg sound files.
2) I strong suggest you do not change any of the set parameters in this template.
3) In FMOD Designer, under the Sound definitions tab, place the desired sound file(s) into the corresponding Event folder.
4) Under the Wave banks tab, rename the bank to ingame_voice; set Bank type to decompress into memory; and set Compression to MP3.
5) Click Build>Build project (top left); Build project for: PC; check the box next to ingame_voice; and click Build.
